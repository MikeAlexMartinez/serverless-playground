Events - 
Resources - 
Services - Encapsulate the above
  They contain a
  - serverless.yml file, main config file
  - function code
  - Dependencies

  in a simple node service
  woofGarden/
  - handler.js
  - serverless.yml

  more complex
    woofGardenPets/
    - handler.js
    - node_modules/
    - serverless.yml
    - package.json
    woofGardenReminders/
    - handler.js
    - node_modules/
    - serverless.yml
    - package.json

a basic serverless.yml

  service:
    name: myService

  provider:
    name: AWS
    runtime: nodejs6.10

  package:
    include:
    - src/**
    - handler.js
    exclude:
    - .git/**
    - .travis.yml

You can also configure resources.
