=======================================================
  Installation
    - Serverless Installation
    - OS Differences
    - AWS Setup
  Serverless Application Model
    - Functions, events, resources, and services
  Serverless Development
    - Configuration, deployment, and Testing
  Projects
    - Cron Schdeuled email reminder


=> Serverless Application Model
================================

Functions 
- AWS Lambda
Can trigger with API Gateway
Schedule like Cron
S3
Cloudwatch
DynamoDB
Alexa Skills (IoT)

Events - 
Resources - 
Services - Encapsulate the above
  They contain a
  - serverless.yml file, main config file
  - function code
  - Dependencies

  in a simple node service
  woofGarden/
  - handler.js
  - serverless.yml

  more complex
    woofGardenPets/
    - handler.js
    - node_modules/
    - serverless.yml
    - package.json
    woofGardenReminders/
    - handler.js
    - node_modules/
    - serverless.yml
    - package.json

a basic serverless.yml

  service:
    name: myService

  provider:
    name: AWS
    runtime: nodejs6.10

  package:
    include:
    - src/**
    - handler.js
    exclude:
    - .git/**
    - .travis.yml

You can also configure resources.

## Creating a Project

bookstrap service files using 'serverless' aka sls command
amend serverless.yml file

Creating our first serverless service:
  1 - Create Service
  2 - Serverless.yml
  3 - handler.js
..


Serverless Plugins
- Overview
- 'serverless-finch'

Serverless APIs
- Component Overview
- API Gateway
- HTTP API Configuration

Project - Text Notification Website
- Google Recpatcha & Twilio setup
- Service Scaffolding
- Functions
- API endpoints
- Deployment

To install a plugin we should use npm for installs and 
will also need to amend the serverless config file to
add the required plugins.
  We might need a custom section to define custom options.

Serverless APIs

The API Gateway is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure
APIs at any scale.
- Easy to make REST Apis, scalable and secure
- INtegrates easily with AWS Lambda
- Easy pricing - 1m requests are free.
- Transfer

We can pass variables using endpoint parameters e.g. {id}

You may also need to manage environment variables.
